Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
ANS)

-> SSH keys helps us to avoid writing username and password every single time when you push any change to github and authenticate it.
-> SSH (Secure Shell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data.

->SSH keys are more difficult to hack than passwords and thus are more secure.


Ques -  How to edit last commit message in git?
ANS)

-> To edit last commit message on git by just using command " git commit --amend " 
   This will will open your editor, allowing you to change the commit message of the most recent commit.
   
   And also helps to et the commit message directly in the command line with :-
   
      git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
      
      By this way we can edit last most recent commit message.
